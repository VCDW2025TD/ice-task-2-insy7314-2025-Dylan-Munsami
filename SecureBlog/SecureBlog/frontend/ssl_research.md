\#  SSL/TLS Research



SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols that secure data between clients and servers. TLS is the successor to SSL and is stronger and more efficient. HTTPS (HTTP over TLS) protects data integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity, unlike plain HTTP which is vulnerable to interception.  



Without SSL/TLS, sensitive data such as login credentials can be stolen through man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. Real-world cases like the 2010 Firesheep attack showed how easily unencrypted sessions could be hijacked. Misconfigured SSL has also caused outages and security breaches on major sites. HTTPS is now a baseline requirement for safe web development.
